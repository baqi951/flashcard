            <div class="meaning mean1">
                <p>JavaScript is an essential part of the web development trio, along with HTML (which provides the
                    structure of web pages) and CSS (which handles the design and layout). While HTML defines the
                    content and CSS defines the appearance, JavaScript controls the behavior, enabling websites to be
                    more dynamic and responsive to user interactions.</P>

                <P>JavaScript can run on the client-side (in the user's browser) or on the server-side (using
                    environments like Node.js), which makes it incredibly versatile.</p>

            <div class="meaning mean2">
                <p> A variable is a named storage location that holds a value or reference to a value. It is used to
                    store data that can be accessed, modified, or referenced throughout the program.</p>

            <div class="meaning mean3">
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.It is a stylesheet language used to control the visual
                    appearance and layout of a web page written in HTML or XML. CSS defines the styles for elements like
                    fonts, colors, spacing, positioning, and overall page layout.

            <h1 class="func">Functions</h1>
            <div class="meaning mean4">
                <p> A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions can accept input
                    (parameters) and return output (a result). They are essential for organizing and structuring code
                    efficiently.</p>

            <h1 class="str">Strings</h1>
            <div class="meaning mean5">
                <p>A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are enclosed in either single
                    quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) for template literals. They are immutable, meaning
                    once created, their values cannot be changed directly. Strings can be manipulated using various
                    methods, such as .length, .concat(), .toUpperCase(), and more.</p>

            <h1 class="par">Parameters</h1>
            <div class="meaning mean6">
                <p>Parameters are the named variables used in a function definition to represent the values that will be
                    passed to the function when it is called. They act as placeholders for the data that the function
                    needs to perform its task. When a function is invoked, values (called arguments) are passed to these
                    parameters.</p>

        <div class="boxdiv">
            <div class="meaning mean7">
                <p>Arguments are the values passed to a function when it is called. They correspond to the parameters
                    defined in the function, and the function can use these values to perform its task. Unlike
                    parameters (which are part of the function definition), arguments are provided during the function
                    call.</p>

                <p>Alert() is a built-in function that displays a pop-up message to the user in the form of a dialog
                    box. It is often used for notifying or warning users. The message inside the alert()function is
                    typically a string that appears in the dialog.</p>

                <p>Return is a keyword used to exit a function and optionally send a value back to the place where the
                    function was called. It allows a function to produce a result, which can be used elsewhere in the
                    program.</p>
